# About the program & Required Dependencies:

This is a simple tool that can be used to convert a python program into an executable program, made by Sandman2-0.
This program combines pyinstaller with a visual user interface to make for a quick compiling experience.

To use this program, install the provided [executable file](https://github.com/Sandman2-0/PythonToExe/blob/main/compiler.exe) or install the following dependencies to use the [python file](https://github.com/Sandman2-0/PythonToExe/blob/main/compiler.py):
<br/>- Python

    tested on version 3.9.0 of Python, but should work with other versions.

<br/>- Tkinter

    pip install Tk
<br/>- pyinstaller (Required for the EXE as well)

    pip install pyinstaller

or 

Use the [package installer](https://github.com/Sandman2-0/PythonToExe/blob/main/package_installer.py) provided

# Usage:

Upon launching the program ([compiler.exe](https://github.com/Sandman2-0/PythonToExe/blob/main/compiler.exe) or [compiler.py](https://github.com/Sandman2-0/PythonToExe/blob/main/compiler.py)):
- Click browse, then find the file you would like to compile.
- Check each box based on how you wish to compile the program.
    <br/>-> Compile to One File (Compiles the program and all it's dependencies into one singular EXE)
    <br/>-> No Console (Make the program launch without a console. Good for visual UI programs)

Wait for the conversion process to finish, then find the executable file within the "dist" folder in the same directory as this program.
Prior to first using the program, there will not be any related folders within the file's directory.
