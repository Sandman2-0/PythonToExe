About the program & Dependencies:

This is a simple tool that can be used to convert a python program into an executable program, made by Sandman2-0.
This program combines pyinstaller with a visual user interface to make for a quick compiling experience.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use this program, you will need to install the following:
    1. Python
    2. Tkinter
    3. pyinstaller

>pip install Tk
>pip install pyinstaller

or

Please note: this program was only tested on version 3.9.0 of Python, but should work with other versions.

Usage:

Upon launching the program:
- Click browse, then find the file you would like to compile.
- Check each box based on how you wish to compile the program.
    -Compile to One File (Compiles the program and all it's dependencies into one singular EXE)
    -No Console (Make the program launch without a console. Good for visual UI programs)

Wait for the conversion process to finish, then find the executable file within the "dist" folder in the same directory as this program.
Prior to first using the program, there will not be any related folders within the file's directory.
